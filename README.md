# Simple Linear Regression - ML Project

Hi, Iâ€™m Swapnil Madhukar Panchal, a Computer Engineering student at MGMâ€™s College of Engineering, Nanded.

## ðŸ“Œ Project: Simple Linear Regression

This is my first machine learning project. It demonstrates how a simple linear regression model can be built using Python to predict values based on a linear relationship.

### ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### ðŸ“š What I Learned:
- Loading and preparing datasets
- Visualizing data using matplotlib
- Applying scikit-learnâ€™s `LinearRegression` model
- Evaluating model performance using Mean Squared Error

### ðŸš€ Future Plans:
This is just the beginning! Next up, Iâ€™ll be learning multiple regression, classification, and working on real-world ML projects.
